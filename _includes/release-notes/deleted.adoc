[#removed-toolbar-button-types]
=== Removed toolbar button types

https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-4x/demo/custom-toolbar-listbox/[Listbox] is no longer a supported toolbar button type in TinyMCE 5.0. Though listbox has been removed, any functionality provided by custom listbox toolbar buttons can be retained by switching to a different kind of toolbar button using the new methods. The recommended toolbar button type to switch to is the *Split* button.
