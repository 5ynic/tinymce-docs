These Release Notes provide a high-level coverage of: improvements and additions, known issues, important bug fixes & deprecated functionality associated with the release of TinyMCE 5.1.


### Get TinyMCE 5.1
TinyMCE 5.1 can be deployed by the Tiny Cloud using a Tiny Cloud API key, or TinyMCE can be self-hosted.

Signing up for a free API key provides entitlements to all our free plugins. This includes advanced functionality such as the [Image tools]({{  site.baseurl }}/plugins/imagetools/) plugin, which requires a cloud image proxy server to already be configured. Premium plugins can be purchased at any time once the API key has been set up.

Refer to the [Quick start]({{site.baseurl}}/quick-start) docs for information on getting started with Tiny Cloud.

For information on self-hosting TinyMCE, see: [Advanced installation choices]({{site.baseurl}}/general-configuration-guide/advanced-install/).
