== min_width

This option allows you to set the minimum width that a user can stretch the entire TinyMCE interface (by grabbing the dragable area in the bottom right of the editor interface) when using the modern theme.

____
Note that this behavior is different than the link:/plugins/autoresize[`autoresize`] plugin, which controls the resizing of the editable area only, not the entire editor.

===== Example

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  min_width: 400
});
`

____
Pro tip: by default the <<resize,`resize`>> handle does not allow horizontal dragging and giving this key a value will not result in an observable behavior.
