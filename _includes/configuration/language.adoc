== language

This option allows you to specify the language that {productname}'s user interface will appear in. That is, the toolbar buttons and menu items. By default, {productname} will use US English as the language of the interface.

If you wish to use a language other than English, please follow these steps:

. Download the language pack you wish to use link:{gettiny}/language-packages/[from here].
. Unpack the language file into your `tinymce/langs` folder.
. Set the link:{baseurl}/configure/localization/#language[`language`] option in your {productname} configuration to the language code in the list below (which you'll also find on the language pack link:{gettiny}/language-packages/[download page].
. Confirm that the language has been set successfully by loading {productname}.

Please note, the language code you set in your {productname} configuration must match the filename of the language file. If the language file is not found, {productname} will not load.

*Type:* `String`

*Default Value:* `en_US`

[discrete#example]

tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  language: 'sv_SE'
});
