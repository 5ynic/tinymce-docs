It is now possible for users of your application to send notifications to other users through an `@mention` in the document. AtMentions are of course incredibly commonplace in social software such as Twitter and Facebook along with social enterprise applications such as IBMâ€™s Connections suite.

The value to developers building modern enterprise solutions is obvious. Your users communicate every day using `@mentions` on social networks, and they expect to be able to use them when creating content too.

## Downloading AtMentions

A [TinyMCE Enterprise](https://www.tinymce.com/pricing/) subscription includes the ability to download and install the AtMentions feature for the editor.

Please note that this feature requires a backend integration with a system to handle listing of users, as well as sending the notification. This is [explained in our example code](https://www.tinymce.com/docs/plugins/mentions/), but basically, there are two integration points: getting a userlist when `@abc...` is typed, and on submitting the form, sending a notification to the `@mentions` in the document.
