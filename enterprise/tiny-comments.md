The Tiny Comments plugin provides the user an ability to start or join a conversation by adding comments to the content within the TinyMCE editor.

Users can now add comments to their text from within their TinyMCE editor for collaboration, review, and providing feedback.

Currently, there are two versions of Comments compatible with TinyMCE v4 -

* [Comments 1.0]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/comments/comments_1.0)

## Collaborate on your projects within your content

Tiny Comments offers the following primary functionality:

* A **user interface** to collaborate on content by creating and replying to comments.
* A way to control the delete operation on a comment/comment thread if you want to remove it from your content.
