Permanent Pen is a premium {{site.productname}} plugin for applying a pre-defined format (for example, color, typeface and type style, font, etc.) to a desired section of content. The ability to store information for reuse saves the user time and ensures consistency across the content.

This allows the user to add text without modifying the original content.
