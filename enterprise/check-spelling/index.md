## Downloading Spell Checker Pro

A [TinyMCE Enterprise](http://www.tinymce.com/pricing/) subscription includes the ability to download and install a spell check as-you-type feature for the editor.

Spell Checker Pro requires both a client-side plugin to be configured and a server-side component to be installed and configured.
