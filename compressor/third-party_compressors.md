The TinyMCE compressor is a backend for reducing the overall download and initialization time for TinyMCE it consists of a JavaScript loader that requests a php/aspx/jsp/cfm page that compresses the specified resources using GZip. This method makes the overall download 75% smaller and the number of requests will also be reduced. The overall initialization time for TinyMCE will be reduced dramatically if you use this script for loading TinyMCE.

## What is GZip?

gzip is short for GNU zip, a GNU free software file compression program. It was created by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler. Version 0.1 was first publicly released on October 31, 1992\. Version 1.0 followed in February 1993\. The HTTP/1.1 protocol allows for clients to optionally request the compression of content from the server.
