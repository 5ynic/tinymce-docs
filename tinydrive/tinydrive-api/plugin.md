The Tiny Drive TinyMCE plugin has an api that enables access to tinydrive from your custom plugins. This api is available though the `editor.plugins.tinydrive` property.

## tinydrive.pick

The `tinydrive.pick` method enables you to pick files from the Tiny Drive and get the selected files returned as meta data in a promise. For a complete list of available settings check the 

### File Picker Result Format

The file picker api call will return a promise with a `files` property. This `files` property is an array of files with the following properties.

#### name

The name of the selected file for example `my.jpg`.

#### size

The size in bytes of the selected file.

#### url

The url for the selected file would be in the following format: `https://drive.tiny.cloud/1/<your api key>/<file uuid>`

#### mdate

The modification date for the file in ISO 8601 format for example `2019-02-24T15:00:00Z`

### Demo

{% include codepen.html id="drive-plugin-pick" %}

## tinydrive.browse

The `tinydrive.browse` method enables you to browse your files stored in Tiny Drive but not insert/pick them. This might be useful if you want to use Tiny Drive as a generic file manager. It returns a promise but the promise will only resolve when the Tiny Drive dialog is closed.

### Demo

{% include codepen.html id="drive-plugin-browse" %}

## tinydrive.upload

The `tinydrive.upload` method enables directly upload blobs to your Tiny Drive storage. This can be useful when you want to store a file generated by your app.

### Demo

{% include codepen.html id="drive-plugin-upload" %}

## Picker settings

These settings are available for the [tinydrive.pick](#pick) / [tinydrive.browse](#browse) api methods.

### `filetypes`

This setting enables to restrict what types of files you want do display based on file type categories. For example if your app needs to insert images only then you can specify `['image']` in the file types array.

**Type:** `Array<string>`

#### Example

```js
tinydrive.pick({
  filetypes: ['image']
}).then((result) => {
  console.log(result.files);
});
```

### Available file types

The file types are a set of file extensions.

* `document` - doc, xls, ppt, pps, docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf, rtf, txt, key, pages, numbers
* `audio` - wav, wave, mp3, ogg, oga, ogx, ogm, spx, opus
* `video` - mp4, m4v, ogv, webm, mov
* `image` - gif, jpeg, jpg, png, tif, tiff, bmp
* `archive` - zip

### `max_image_dimension`

This setting enables constraining the width/height of uploaded images. When this is enabled any images with a higher width or height than the specified amount would be proportionally resized down to the specified maximum dimension.

**Type:** `Number`

#### Example

```js
tinydrive.pick({
  max_image_dimension: 1024
}).then((result) => {
  console.log(result.files);
});
```

### Plugin api interfaces

Here is a complete api reference as TypeScript types for developers used to TypeScript syntax.

```tsx
interface PluginApi {
  pick: (settings: PluginPickerApiSettings) => Promise<PickerResult>;
  browse: (settings: PluginPickerApiSettings) => Promise<void>;
  upload: (settings: PluginUploadApiSettings) => Promise<void>;
}

interface PluginPickerApiSettings {
  filetypes?: string[];
}

interface PluginUploadApiSettings {
  path?: string;
  name: string;
  blob: Blob;
  onprogress?: (details: DirectUploadProgress) => void;
  max_image_dimension?: number;
}

interface PickerFile {
  url: string;
  size: number;
  name: string;
  type: string;
  mdate: string;
}

interface PickerResult {
  files: PickerFile[];
}

interface DirectUploadProgress {
  loaded: number;
  total: number;
}
