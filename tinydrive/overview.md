Tiny Drive is a premium TinyMCE plugin for cloud-based asset management and storage solution.

Tiny Drive allows trouble free management of assets such as images and files in the cloud. Files can be draged and dropped to be instantly uploaded to the cloud storage using a [CDN or Content Delivery Network]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/getting-started/concepts/#cdn) to serve the required files and images.

You can manage file uploads, storage, processing, and delivery for your website or app. Learn more about our concepts here.

All components of our infrastructure seamlessly work as a whole, are easy to configure, and can be deeply flexible when needed.

Our upload UI, libs, and APIs are built by developers for developers. In turn, we design Tiny Drive integrations to be non-coder ready, easy to configure, and well-covered with documentation and guides.


## Demo

Here is a quick demo on how Tiny Drive integrates with TinyMCE.

### Creating an account

If you would like to try out Drive and our Cloud-delivered editor, the first step is to create a free [Tiny account](https://www.tiny.cloud/download/).  When you create an account, you are assigned an API key, which is required for the implementation of Drive.

> The API key is also provisioned with a free 30-day trial of all of our [premium plugins](https://apps.tiny.cloud/product-category/tiny-cloud-extensions/), with no credit card information or commitment required.


Start off your Tiny Drive journey with checking out our [Getting Started]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/getting-started/), analyzing your image performance, or head straight to our [signup](https://apps.tiny.cloud/my-account/) page.

Refer to the other documents like [Third-Party libraries]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/libraries) and [Integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/integrations/) to gain understanding of the Tiny Drive configuration process.

In order to implement Tiny Drive you need prior knowledge of JSON Web Token (or JWT) in detail, including how they can be used for user authentication and session management in a web application. There will be some coding involved on both the client-side and the server-side to configure JWT as per the instructions in this section.
We recommend reading up and trying to understand how [JWT authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/jwt-authentication/) works.

> Note: For support related issues such as problems with JWT authentication and implementing Tiny Drive, check our [help page](/tinydrive/get-help/) or please contact [support](https://support.tiny.cloud/hc/en-us/requests/new).
