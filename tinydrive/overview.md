Tiny Drive allows you to manage your images and files in the cloud, when you are setup with your system, you will enjoy trouble free management of assets in the cloud.

You will be able to drag and drop files to instantly upload them to cloud storage behind a blazing fast CDN helping you serve the files and images you need.

You can manage file uploads, storage, processing, and delivery for your website or app. Learn more about our concepts here.

All components of our infrastructure seamlessly work as a whole, are easy to configure, and can be deeply flexible when needed.

Our upload UI, libs, and APIs are built by developers for developers. In turn, we design Tiny Drive integrations to be non-coder ready, easy to configure, and well-covered with documentation and guides.


## Demo

Here is a quick demo on how Tiny Drive integrates with TinyMCE.

Start off your Tiny Drive journey with checking out our [Getting Started]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/getting-started/), analyzing your image performance, or head straight to our [signup](https://apps.tiny.cloud/my-account/) page.

Weâ€™re striving to make Tiny Drive as useful and simple as possible. We recommend reading up and trying to understand how [JWT authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/jwt-authentication/) works. In order to implement Tiny Drive you need prior knowledge of JSON Web Token (or JWT) in detail, including how they can be used for user authentication and session management in a web application. There will be some coding involved on both the client-side and the server-side to configure JWT as per the instructions in this section.

> Note: For support related issues such as problems with JWT authentication and implementing Tiny Drive, check our [help page](/tinydrive/get-help/) or please contact [support](https://support.tiny.cloud/hc/en-us/requests/new).
