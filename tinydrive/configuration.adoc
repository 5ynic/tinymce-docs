[#]
=== `tinydrive_token_provider`

This setting could take one of the following two forms:

* A URL to a page that takes an HTTP JSON POST request and produces a JSON structure with a valid JWT. It uses a POST request to avoid caching by browsers and proxies.
* A function that provides the same token through a callback. This allows making an HTTP request in any desired format. The provider function is a function that has a success and failure callback where the success takes an object with a token property containing the JWT, and the failure callback takes a string to present as an error message if the token could not be produced.

For more information on how to create these tokens, refer to the link:{{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/jwt-authentication/[JWT authentication guide] or try one of the link:{{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/getting-started/#starterprojects[starter projects].

*Type:* `String` or `Function`

*Required:* yes

[#example-using-a-jwt-provider-url]
==== Example Using a JWT Provider URL

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: 'tinydrive',
  tinydrive_token_provider: '/jwt' // this can be a page or endpoint like this
});
`

[#example-using-a-jwt-provider-callback]
==== Example Using a JWT Provider Callback

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: "tinydrive",
  tinydrive_token_provider: function (success, failure) {
     success({ token: 'jwt-token' });
     // failure('Could not create a jwt token')
  }
});
`

[#-2]
=== `tinydrive_upload_path`

This setting enables changing the default upload path for files that get uploaded when pasted into the editor, uploaded directly through the Image dialog, or when an image is dragged-and-dropped into the editor. It will produce a date-based structure within this path like this `+/uploads/{year}{month}{day}+`. This is to avoid having thousands of files in the same directory.

*Type:* `String`

*Default Value:* `"/uploads"`

[#example]
==== Example

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: "tinydrive",
  tinydrive_upload_path: '/some/other/path'
});
`

[#-2]
=== `tinydrive_max_image_dimension`

This setting enables constraining the width/height of uploaded images. When this is enabled any images with a higher width or height than the specified amount would be proportionally resized down to the specified maximum dimension.

*Type:* `Number`

[#example-2]
==== Example

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: "tinydrive",
  tinydrive_max_image_dimension: 1024
});

[#configuring-the-insert-file-toolbar-button]
=== Configuring the Insert File toolbar button

{{site.cloudfilemanager}} will automatically integrate into the Image, Link, and Media dialogs as a file picker. It can also be configured to insert files directly into any content using the `insertfile` button. To enable this button, add it to the toolbar editor setting.

The Insert File toolbar button will insert images as `img` elements or other files as links to that file.

[#example-2]
==== Example

This is an example of configuring the 'insertfile' toolbar button.

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML

});
