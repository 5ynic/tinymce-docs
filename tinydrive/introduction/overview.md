Tiny Drive is a premium TinyMCE plugin for cloud-based asset management and storage solution.

Tiny Drive allows trouble free management of assets such as images and files in the cloud. Files can be draged and dropped to be instantly uploaded to the cloud storage using a [CDN or Content Delivery Network]({{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/introduction/concepts/#cdn) to serve the required files and images.

You can manage file uploads, storage, processing, and delivery for your website or app. Learn more about our concepts here.

All components of our infrastructure seamlessly work as a whole, are easy to configure, and can be deeply flexible when needed.

Our upload UI, libs, and APIs are built by developers for developers. In turn, we design Tiny Drive integrations to be non-coder ready, easy to configure, and well-covered with documentation and guides.
