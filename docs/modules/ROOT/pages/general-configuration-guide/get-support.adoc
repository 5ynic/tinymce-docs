[#q-the-icons-are-missing-when-installing-on-my-server]

[#q-why-do-buttonsselect-boxes-have-the-incorrect-size]
=== Q: Why do buttons/select boxes have the incorrect size?

You are probably using an old `DOCTYPE`. As of {productname} 4, a proper HTML5 doctype is required. All web developers should use a standard rendering mode on their web pages. Use a HTML5 doctype like `<!DOCTYPE html>` to properly render the page and the {productname} UI.

[#q-is-tinymce-protected-against-xss-vulnerabilities]
=== Q: Is TinyMCE protected against XSS vulnerabilities?

The server should have protection against XSS attacks implemented. Since if you can submit contents in a form using {productname} one could as easily disable all JavaScript and therefore bypass {productname} filtering and still submit HTML code with insecure content. You need to properly filter the HTML input on the server using things like http://htmlpurifier.org/[HTML Purifier].

[#q-how-do-i-convert-my-urls-to-relative-absolute-or-absolute-with-the-domain]
=== Q: How do I convert my URLs to relative, absolute, or absolute with the domain?

[#relative-urls]
==== Relative URLs

The *Relative URLs* converts all URLs within the same domain to relative URLs. The URLs are relative from the `document_base_url`.

`+js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  relative_urls : true,
  document_base_url : 'http://www.site.com/path1/'
});
+`

[#example]
===== Example

`+http://www.site.com/path1/path2/file.htm >> path2/file.htm+`

[#absolute-urls]
==== Absolute URLs

The *Absolute URLs* converts all relative URLs to absolute URLs. The URLs are `absolute` based on the `document_base_url`.

`+js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  relative_urls : false,
  remove_script_host : true,
  document_base_url : 'http://www.site.com/path1/'
});
+`

[#example-2]
===== Example

`path2/file.htm >> /path1/path2/file.htm`

[#domain-absolute-urls]
==== Domain absolute URLs

The *Domain absolute URLs* converts all relative URLs to absolute URLs. The URLs are `absolute` based on the `document_base_url` with the domain.

`+js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  relative_urls : false,
  remove_script_host : false,
  document_base_url : 'http://www.site.com/path1/'
});
+`

[#example-2]
===== Example

`+path2/file.htm >> http://www.site.com/path1/path2/file.htm+`
