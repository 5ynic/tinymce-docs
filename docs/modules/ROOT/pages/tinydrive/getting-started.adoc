:title_nav: Getting started

== Requirements
1. Register for an API key at link:{accountsignup}[{accountpage}]
2. Generate a JWT key at link:{accountpageurl}[{accountpage}]
3. Store these keys temporarily, you will need them later.

Do this before proceeding and it will go a lot smoother

{cloudfilemanager} allows trouble free management of assets such as images and files in the cloud. {cloudfilemanager} is only available in link:{accountsignup}[{cloudname}] and requires registering for an API key.

To enable this functionality in the {productname} editor, add `tinydrive` to the list of plugins in the `tinymce.init` call. The user also needs to be authenticated using a link:{modulesDir}/tinydrive/jwt-authentication/[JSON Web Token (JWT)].

Once {cloudfilemanager} is enabled, it integrates as the default file picker for the Image, Link, and Media dialogs and as the default upload handler for local images being pasted or inserted into the document.

[#implementing-with-your-system]
=== Implementing with your system

The next step, after seeing how {cloudfilemanager} works in these starter projects, is trying to implement it with your own system, the link:{modulesDir}/tinydrive/jwt-authentication/[JSON Web Token] authentication solution would have to be tied to the login authentication of your system. This usually means integrating the JWT authentication to the existing session authentication so that users automatically login to {cloudfilemanager} and your system at the same time.
