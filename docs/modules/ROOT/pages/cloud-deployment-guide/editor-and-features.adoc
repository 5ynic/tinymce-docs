{cloudname} is the easiest way to integrate {productname} and upgrade to premium plugins.

{cloudname} can be used without an API key. Refer to the link:{rootDir}general-configuration-guide[Introduction & getting started] guide for more information. Sign up for an API key and update the script tag to use premium plugins or avoid the in-editor developer warning.

All {cloudname} accounts include a free, pre-configured {cloudname} image proxy service. This setup uses the link:{rootDir}plugins/imagetools.html[Image tools] plugin.

[#step-1-insert-the-tiny-cloud-script-tag-into-the-webpage]
=== Step 1: Insert the Tiny Cloud script tag into the webpage

Insert the {productname} editor code into the application to load {productname} for the first time. The code inserting is done by adding the following script tag into your app, or in the case of a web page the `<head>` of the page:

The following example adds a script tag into the application that inserts the code. Use the `<head>` of the page on a web page. Be sure to substitute 'no-api-key' with your api key.

`js
<script src="{cdnurl}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
`

|===
|  | Value | Description

| 1
| no-api-key
| Replace with your api key

| 2
| origin=
| A `referrerpolicy` specifies how much of the current page's URL is sent in the `Referer` header when the browser fetches page resources (for example, the {productname} editor). The use of the `Referer` header ensures API keys are only used on domains registered to their owners. We only care about the domain portion however (similar to the operation of `Origin` header), so for improved performance and privacy always set the `referrerpolicy` to `origin` when requesting {cloudname} resources.
