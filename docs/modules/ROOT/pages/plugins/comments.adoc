{premiumplugin}

The Comments 2.0 plugin provides the ability to start or join a conversation by adding comments to the content within the {productname} editor. The Comments 2.0 plugin is built upon the link:{modulesDir}/advanced/annotations/[Annotations API] and uses annotations to create comment threads (conversations).

Comments is a premium plugin from {companyname}. Please see the link:{modulesDir}/enterprise/tiny-comments/[Premium features] section for all the buying options.

After obtaining the Comments 2.0 plugin, refer to the following instructions for using it.

[#add-the-comments-2-0-plugin]
== Add the Comments 2.0 plugin

To add the Comments 2.0 plugin to the {productname} editor, use the following script:
`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: '#tiny-ui .editor',
  plugins: 'paste tinycomments',
  tinycomments_mode: 'embedded',
  tinycomments_author: 'Author'
});
`

[#modes]
=== Modes

There are two modes available in Comments 2.0 that provide the ability to save comments. These modes are configured in the Comments 2.0 settings.

* *Callback Mode* - This is the default mode in Comments. This mode is used to configure storage and save comments on the user's server. This option gives the user a choice of configuring the storage settings to either persist comments immediately or save them at the same time as the content. Additional callbacks must be configured to use Comments in callback mode.
* *Embedded Mode* - This mode allows the user to store the comments within the content. No additional callbacks are required to be configured to use this mode.

[#configuring-comments-2-0-callback-mode]

[#using-comments-2-0-embedded-mode-with-the-full-page-plugin]
== Using Comments 2.0 embedded mode with the Full Page plugin

Users have to be cautious when deciding the order in which the plugins are added in the plugins list.

Comments can cause an issue if the link:{modulesDir}/plugins/fullpage/[Full Page] plugin `fullpage` appears before Comments 2.0 plugin `tinycomments` in the plugin list, and `tinycomments` is configured to use `embedded mode`.

The order that the plugins appear affects the order that the `getContent` hooks are processed in. This creates an issue with `tinycomments` working as expected since the `fullpage` plugin adds outer `<html>` elements before `tinycomments` adds its comment data. This leads to the comment data being in the wrong place. The consequence of this situation is that when a saved document is re-opened, the comment data is lost (but the highlights are still there).

For a workaround, please ensure that `tinycomments` is listed before `fullpage` in the plugins list. This should result in `tinycomments` working properly.
