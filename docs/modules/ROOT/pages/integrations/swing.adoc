Users can easily configure the {productname} editor in Swing through the *{productname} for Swing* integration.

[#getting-the-tinymce-for-swing-integration]
== Getting the TinyMCE for Swing integration

To start using {productname} for Swing as your new rich text editor, the first step is to obtain a copy of the *Integration*.

Contact link:{supporturl}[{supportname}] to discuss how to get started with our latest release.

[#get-started-with-our-tinymce-in-swing-integration]
== Get started with our TinyMCE in Swing integration

To include our {productname} in Swing integration in your Java project just follow the steps below:

[#1-copy-tinymce-in-swing-libraries]
=== 1. Copy TinyMCE in Swing libraries

From the release `zip` file, select all the Java libraries under the `lib` folder and import them into your project. This libraries contain everything needed to run our integration.

[#2-select-a-deployment-and-create-a-configuration]
=== 2. Select a deployment and create a configuration

The Swing integration allows the user to select the origin of the {productname} code: *cloud*, *embedded*, or *external*.

* Cloud deployments pull the latest release of {productname} from the channel of your choice. Use this option by passing your API key and selecting a release channel.
+
`
final Config myTinyConfiguration = Config.cloud("<my_api_key>", "{productmajorversion}-stable");
`

* Embedded deployments use the version of {productname} prepackaged with the current release of the integration.
+
`
final Config myTinyConfiguration = Config.embedded();
`

* External deployments allow to use a local version of {productname} by giving the address of the location where {productname} is being served.
+
`
final Config myTinyConfiguration = Config.external("http://<my_server>/<path>/tinymce.min.js");
`

The configuration can be customized via Java or by passing Javascript function that returns a {productname} configuration object.

`
final HashMap<String, String> tinyProperties = new HashMap<>();
tinyProperties.put("menubar", "false");
tinyProperties.put("plugins", "advlist autolink lists link image anchor searchreplace visualblocks code insertdatetime media table powerpaste code help");
tinyProperties.put("toolbar", "undo redo | formatselect | bold italic backcolor | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | removeformat | help");
final Config myConfig = Config.embedded().addProperties(tinyProperties);
`

[#3-create-the-editor-and-add-it-to-your-view]
=== 3. Create the editor and add it to your view

Create the editor by passing a configuration object. The editor initialization is asynchronous so starting a new editor will return a future value that can be accessed as a normal future value.

`
final Config myConfig = Config.embedded();
final TinyMCE editor = TinyMCE.futureEditor(myConfig).get();
editor.setBody("Hello World!");
final JPanel holder = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
holder.add(editor.component(), BorderLayout.CENTER);
`

Once the editor has been extracted from the future value you can use its component (JComponent) to position it in your view.
