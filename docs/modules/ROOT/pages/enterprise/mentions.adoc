:description: Mentions brings social sharing to TinyMCE.
:keywords: atmention mention

It is now possible for users to send notifications to other users using the Mentions plugin through an `@username` in the document. Using `@username` for notifications are incredibly commonplace in social software such as Twitter and Facebook along with social enterprise applications such as IBM's Connections suite.

Users can communicate every day using `@username` on social networks and can expect to be able to use them when creating content too.

There are two deployment options. One is with {cloudname}, the other is the more traditional Self-hosted route, requiring an additional link:{rootDir}enterprise/server.html[server-side component] to be installed and configured.

Please note that this feature requires a backend integration with a system to handle listing of users, as well as sending the notifications. Refer to this link:{rootDir}plugins/mentions.html#example[example code] for more information. There are two integration points: getting a user list when `+@abc...+` is typed, and on submitting the form, sending a notification to the `@username` in the document.
