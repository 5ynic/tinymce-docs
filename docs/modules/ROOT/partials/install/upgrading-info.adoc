[[upgrading-tinymce-self-hosted-manually]]
=== Upgrading TinyMCE Self-hosted manually

To upgrade to {productname} {productminorversion} using a manually downloaded package:

. Backup the `{prodnamecode}/` directory so any customizations can be restored after the upgrade.
+
Customizations for {productname} are typically stored in the following directories:
+
```sh
tinymce/
├── icons/
├── langs/
├── plugins/
├── skins/
│   ├── content/
│   └── ui/
└── themes/
```

. Download the latest version of {productname}.
 ** For the {productname} Community Version, download `{prodnamecode}_<VERSION>.zip` from link:{gettiny}/self-hosted/[Get {productname} - Self-hosted releases], where _`<VERSION>`_ is the latest version of {productname}.
 ** For the {productname} Enterprise Version, download the *{productname} Enterprise Bundle* from link:{accountpageurl}/downloads/[{accountpage} > Downloads]. The downloaded file will be named `enterprise_latest.zip`.
. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to a temporary location.
. (If required) Install the latest language packs from link:{gettiny}/language-packages/[Get {productname} - Language Packages].
. Copy customizations to the new `{prodnamecode}/` directory. Ensure that _only custom changes_ are added the new `{prodnamecode}/` directory, such as:
 ** Custom icons packs
 ** Custom plugins
 ** Custom skins
 ** Custom themes
. Delete the existing `{prodnamecode}/` directory and replace with the new `{prodnamecode}/`.

[NOTE]
====
To simplify the upgrade process to future versions of {productname}:

. Host the {productname} customizations outside of the `{prodnamecode}/` directory.
. Update your {productname} configuration as required:
 ** Set the location of content CSS customizations using link:{rootDir}configure/content-appearance.html#content_css[`content_css`].
 ** Set the location of custom plugins using link:{rootDir}configure/integration-and-setup.html#external_plugins[`external_plugins`].
 ** Set the location of custom icon packages using link:{rootDir}configure/editor-appearance.html#icons_url[`icons_url`] instead of `icons`.
 ** Set the location of custom localization packages using link:{rootDir}configure/localization.html#language_url[`language_url`] instead of `language`.
 ** Set the location of custom skin packages using link:{rootDir}configure/editor-appearance.html#skin_url[`skin_url`] instead of `skin`.
 ** Set the location of custom themes using link:{rootDir}configure/editor-appearance.html#theme_url[`theme_url`] instead of `theme`.
