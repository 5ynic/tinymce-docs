[id="{plugin}_block_drop"]
=== {plugin}_block_drop

Due to browser limitations, it is not possible to filter content that is dragged and dropped into the editor. When `+{plugin}_block_drop+` is set to true the plugin will disable drag and dropping content into the editor. This prevents the unfiltered content from being introduced. Copy and paste is still enabled.

*Default value:* `false`

*Possible values:*  `true`, `false`
