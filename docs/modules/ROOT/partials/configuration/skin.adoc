== skin

This option allows you to specify the skin that {productname} should use. The default skin included with {productname} is named "oxide".

*Type:* `String`

The name of the skin should match the name of the folder within the skins directory of {productname}. If the specified skin is not found, {productname} will not load.

`js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  skin: "oxide"
});
`
