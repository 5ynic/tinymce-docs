So far we've been using the Cloud version of TinyMCE and while it's the easiest way to instantiate the editor it may not always be the best way. In this section we explain some of TinyMCE's other installation options including package managers, downloading the SDK, and the custom build option.

On this page you'll find a detailed guide to our installation options:
