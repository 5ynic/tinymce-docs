This article describes your obligations to attribute your use of {{site.productname}} in your project or product.

## Paid Customers

You are not obligated to implement attribution if you are using {{site.productname}} on a paid tier of {{site.cloudname}} or you self-host under an active commercial license agreement.

## Free & Open Source Users

Users on a free tier of {{site.cloudname}} are required by the [Terms of Service](https://about.tiny.cloud/legal/tiny-cloud-services-subscription-agreement/) to have attribution be visible when TinyMCE is shown.

Users of {{site.productname}} under the LGPL v2.1 open source license are required to give prominent notice though implementing attribution.

## Implementing Attribution

When including attribution, the following requirements must be met:

* "**POWERED BY TINY**" to be stated or the [{{site.companyname}} logo]({{site.url}}/guidelines/#logo) placed in a readily visible location whenever the editor is loaded.
* The word "**Tiny**" or the {{site.companyname}} logo should have a hyperlink to [{{site.url}}]({{site.url}}).
* The location of the product attribution is to be:

  * In the right-hand corner of the status bar of the {{site.productname}} editor; or
  * An alternate location adjacent to the {{site.productname}} editor that is no less prominent.

The following example shows the status bar product attribution in the bottom, right-hand corner:
