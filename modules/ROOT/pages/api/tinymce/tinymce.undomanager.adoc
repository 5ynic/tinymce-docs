[[clear]]
=== clear

clear()

Removes all undo levels.

[[extra]]
=== extra

extra(callback1:function, callback2:function)

Adds an extra "hidden" undo level by first applying the first mutation and store that to the undo stack then roll back that change and do the second mutation on top of the stack. This will produce an extra undo level that the user doesn't see until they undo.

==== Parameters

* `+callback1+` `+(function)+` - Function that does mutation but gets stored as a "hidden" extra undo level.
* `+callback2+` `+(function)+` - Function that does mutation but gets displayed to the user.

[[hasredo]]
=== hasRedo

hasRedo():Boolean

Returns true/false if the undo manager has any redo levels.

==== Return value

* `+Boolean+` - true/false if the undo manager has any redo levels.

[[hasundo]]
=== hasUndo

hasUndo():Boolean

Returns true/false if the undo manager has any undo levels.

==== Return value

* `+Boolean+` - true/false if the undo manager has any undo levels.

[[ignore]]
=== ignore

ignore(callback:function)

Executes the specified mutator function as an undo transaction. But without adding an undo level. Any logic within the translation that adds undo levels will be ignored. So a translation can include calls to execCommand or editor.insertContent.

==== Parameters

[[redo]]
=== redo

redo():Object

Redoes the last action.

==== Return value

* `+Object+` - Redo level or null if no redo was performed.

[[transact]]
=== transact

transact(callback:function):Object

Executes the specified mutator function as an undo transaction. The selection before the modification will be stored to the undo stack and if the DOM changes it will add a new undo level. Any logic within the translation that adds undo levels will be ignored. So a translation can include calls to execCommand or editor.insertContent.

==== Parameters

* `+callback+` `+(function)+` - Function that gets executed and has dom manipulation logic in it.

==== Return value

* `+Object+` - Undo level that got added or null it a level wasn't needed.
