= dialog_type

This option enables you to specify how dialogs/popups should be opened. Possible values are "window" and "modal", where the "window" option opens a normal window and the "modal" option opens a modal dialog. This option is set to "window" by default.

Note that this currently only has an effect in Internet Explorer (in other browsers, "window" is always used).
