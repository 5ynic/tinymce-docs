= readonly

This option enables you to specify make editor instances in readonly mode. When they are in readonly mode nothing can be changed and the contents are just presented to the user. You can use this in combination with https://tiny.cloud/docs-3x/reference/configuration/body_class/[body_class] to present a different visual presentation for the readonly mode.
