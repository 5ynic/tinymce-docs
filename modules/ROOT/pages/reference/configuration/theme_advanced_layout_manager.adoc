= theme_advanced_layout_manager

This option enables you to switch button and panel layout functionality.

There are three different layout manager options:

* SimpleLayout is the default layout manager,
* RowLayout is a more advanced layout manager, and
* CustomLayout executes a custom layout manager function.

Each of these layout managers have different options and can be configured in different ways. This option is only available if the "advanced" xref:reference/configuration/theme.adoc[theme] is used.
