= strict_loading_mode

*Removed in 3.4*

This option will force TinyMCE to load scripts using a DOM insert method instead of document.write on Gecko browsers. Since this results in asynchronous script loading, a built-in synchronizer will ensure that theme, plugin, and language pack files are loaded in the correct order. This will, on the other hand, make the initialization procedure of TinyMCE a bit slower, and that's why this isn't the default behavior. This option is set to true by default if the document content type is application/xhtml+xml.
