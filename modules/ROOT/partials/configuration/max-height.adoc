[[max_height]]
== max_height

This option allows you to set the maximum height that a user can stretch the entire TinyMCE interface (by grabbing the dragable area in the bottom right of the editor interface) when using the modern theme.

[NOTE]
====
Note that this behavior is different than the link:{baseurl}/plugins/autoresize.html[`autoresize`] plugin, which controls the resizing of the editable area only, not the entire editor.
====

*Type:* `Number`

[[example]]
===== Example

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  max_height: 500
});
----

[NOTE]
====
Pro tip: if you set the option <<resize,`resize`>> to `false` the resize handle will be disabled and a user will not be able to resize the editor (by manual dragging).
