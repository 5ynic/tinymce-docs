[[max_width]]
== max_width

This option allows you to set the maximum width that a user can stretch the entire TinyMCE interface (by grabbing the dragable area in the bottom right of the editor interface) when using the modern theme.

[NOTE]
====
Note that this behavior is different than the link:/plugins/autoresize[`autoresize`] plugin, which controls the resizing of the editable area only, not the entire editor.
====

*Type:* `Number`

[[example]]
===== Example

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  max_width: 500
});
----

[NOTE]
====
Pro tip: by default the <<resize,`resize`>> handle does not allow horizontal dragging and giving this key a value will not result in an observable behavior.
