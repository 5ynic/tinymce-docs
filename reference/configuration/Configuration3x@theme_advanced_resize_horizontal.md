This option gives you the ability to enable/disable the horizontal resizing. This option is only useful if the theme_advanced_statusbar_location option is set to "top" or "bottom" and when the theme_advanced_resizing is set to true. This option is set to true by default, allowing both resizing horizontal and vertical.

## Example of usage of the theme_advanced_resize_horizontal option:

```html
tinyMCE.init({
	...
	theme_advanced_resize_horizontalÂ : false
});

```
