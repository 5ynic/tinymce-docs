If you enable this feature, whitespace such as tabs and spaces will be preserved. Much like the behavior of a <pre> element. This can be handy when integrating TinyMCE with webmail clients. This option is disabled by default.

## Example of usage of the preformatted option:

```js
tinyMCE.init({
	...
	preformattedÂ : true
});
```
